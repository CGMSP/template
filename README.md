## Subdomains for kazmal.tech
Most of my subdomains I handle with https://repl.it. For example, https://dino.kazmal.tech is hosted with repl.it. For example, the repo for https://dnio.kazmal.tech is at https://repl.it/@KazMalhotra/dinokazmaltech. I use repl.it for these smaller things because it has a nice built in IDE, and is better for rapid development.
